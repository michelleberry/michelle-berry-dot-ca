# personal-website: www.michelleberry.ca
Code for my personal website prepared to be deployed to heroku. An expansion/re-design of my art-gallery website project.
Website should be reachable at www.michelleberry.ca.
Used Django to create website, SQLite for the database although to deploy to heroku I had to dump all the data into a json file, to then be loaded into postgreSQL which is supported by Heroku. 

Features link to my personal resume as well as my personal art gallery. The art gallery is sort of not relevant to my resume at all but whatever maybe someone will find it interesting!
